# Bilbo Wakes Up after the party

Bilbo jumped
	Up.
Bilbo put on
	His dressing-gown.
Bilbo went
	Into the dining-room.
Bilbo saw
	Nobody.
	All the signs of
		a large breakfast.
		a hurried breakfast.
		a fearful mess.
		a mess in the room.
	Crocks
		Piles of them.
		Unwashed.
		In the kitchen.
	Pots and pans
		Nearly every one he possessed.
		Used.
Bilbo was forced to believe
	The party
		of the night before.
		had not been
			part of his bad dreams
			as he had rather hoped.
		because washing-up
			was so dismally real.
Bilbo was relieved
	Really after all
	To think that they had all gone without
		him
		bothering to wake him up
		a thank-you
Bilbo felt
	That he could not help feeling.
	Just a trifle disappointed.
	Surprised by the feeling.
Bilbo said
	To himself.
	"Don't be a fool"
		"Bilbo Baggins"
		"Thinking at your age of"
			"dragons"
			"all that outlandish nonsense"
Bilbo put on
	An apron.
Bilbo lit
	Fires.
Bilbo boiled
	Water.
Bilbo washed
	Up.
Bilbo went
	In the kitchen.
Bilbo had
	A nice little breakfast.
Bilbo turned out
	The dining-room.
Bilbo began to
	Whistle loudly.
	Forget about the night before.
	Sit down
		to a nice little second beakfast
		in the dining-room	
		by the open window
		when, by that time
			the sun was shining
			the front door was
				open
			letting in a warm spring breeze
			In walked Gandalf!
```

# Bilbo and Gandalf's Conversation

Gandalf said,
	"My dear fellow,"
	"Whenever are you going to come?"
	"What about an early start?"
	"And here you are"
		"having"
			"breakfast"
			"whatever you call it,
		"at half past ten!"
	"They left you"
		"the message"
		"because they could not wait."
Bilbo
	who was
		Poor Mr. Baggins
		in all a fluster,
	said "What message?"
Gandald said,
	"Great Elephants!"
	"You"
		"are not at all yourself this morning"
		"have never dusted the mantelpiece!"
Bilbo said,
	"What's that got to do with it?"
	"I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!"
Gandalf
	said,
		"If you had"
			"dusted the mantelpiece"
				"you would have found"
					"this just under the clock,"
	handed a note
		written on his own note-paper
			of course
		to Bilbo
Bilbo
	Read the note.
Gandalf said
	"you"
		"are left just ten minutes"
		"will have to run"
Biblo said
	"But."
The wizard said,
	"No time for it,"
Biblo said again
	"But"
Gandalf said,
	"No time for that either!"
	"Off you go!"

# Bilbo Leaves and joins The Company!

Bilbo could never remember
	To the end of his days
	how he found himself
		outside
		without
			a hat
			a walking-stick
			any money
			anything that he usually took when he went out
		leaving
			his second breakfast
				half-finished
				quite unwashed-up
		pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands
		running
			as fast as his furry feet could carry him
			down the lane,
			past the great Mill,
			across The Water,
			and then on
			for a mile or more.
Bilbo was very puffed
	when he got to Bywater
	just on the stroke of eleven
Bilbo found he had come
	without a pocket-handkerchief!
Balin said
	"Bravo!"
Balin was
	standing at the inn door
	looking out for him.
All the others came
	Just then
	round the corner of the road
	from the village.
All the others were on ponies
	with all kinds of
		baggages slung about.
		packages slung about.
		parcels slung about.
		paraphernalia slung about
All the others brought a pony
	that was very small.
	apparently for Bilbo.
Thorin said,
	"Up you two get"
	"and off we go!"
Bilbo said,
	"I'm awfully sorry,"
	"But I have come without my hat"
	"I have left my pocket-handkerchief behind"
	"I haven't got any money."
	"I didn't get your note until after 10.45 to be precise."
Dwalin said,
	Don't
		be precise,
		worry!
	You will have to manage without
		pocket-handkerchiefs,
		a good many other things,
		before you get to the journey's end.
	As for a hat, I have got
		a spare hood in my luggage
		a cloak in my luggage.
Bilbo was wearing
	a hood
		dark-green
		(a little weather-stained)
	a cloak
		dark-green
		borrowed from Dwalin.
	things that
		were too large for him
		made him look rather comic.
		you daren't think what his father Bungo would have thought of him
Bilbo was not wearing
	a beard
		which was his only comfort
		so he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf
Bilbo thought
	the meals didn't come quite as often as he would have liked them,
	began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.
```
```
# The Adventure Begins

The Company
	Started on their adventure
		jogging off from the inn
		one fine morning
		just before May,
		on laden ponies;
	Had not been riding very long
		when up came Gandalf
			very splendid
			on a white horse
			who had brought
				a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs,
				Bilbo's pipe
				Bilbo's tobacco.
			making the party go off along
				very merrily
	Rode forward all day
		telling stories
		sang songs
		except of course
			when they stopped for meals.
	First
		passed through hobbit-lands,
			a wide country
			a respectable country
			a country inhabited by decent folk,
			a country with
				good roads
				an inn or two,
				now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business.
	Then
		they came to lands where people
			spoke strangely,
			sang songs Bilbo had never heard before.
	Now in the Lone-lands,
		they had gone on
			far
			where there were
				no people left
				no inns
				roads growing steadily worse.
		they had been obliged to camp when they could,
		at least it had been dry.
	Not far ahead
		were hills that
			looked dreary
			were rising higher and higher
			had dark with trees.
			on some of them
				had old castles
					with an evil look
					as if they had been built by wicked people.
	The weather that day
		made everything seemed gloomy
		had taken a nasty turn.
		had been
			Mostly as good as May can be, can be, even in merry tales,
		now was
			cold
			wet.

```

# Bilbo Grubmles

Bilbo
	said, "To think it will soon be June!"
	splashed along
		behind the others
		in a very muddy track.
	grumbled because
		It was after tea-time
		It was pouring with rain
		It had been all day;
		his hood was dripping into his eyes
		his cloak was full of water;
		the pony
			was tired
			stumbled on stones
		the others were too grumpy to talk.
	thought,
		"And I'm sure the rain has got into
			the dry clothes
			the food-bags
		"Bother
			burgling
			everything to do with burgling!
	wished,
		"He was at home"
		"He was in hus nice hole"
		"He was by the fire"
		"The kettle just beginning to sing!"
		(It was not the last time that he wished that!)
```
```
# Good luck on their adventures

The Dwarves
	still jogged on,
	never
		turned round
		took any notice of the hobbit.

As they went
	The sun must have gone down somewhere behind the grey clouds
	Everything began to get dark
	Down into a deep valley with a river at the bottom.
	Wind got up
	Willows along its banks bent and sighed.

They Company went
	Fortunately
	over
		an ancient stone bridge
		the river which
			was swollen with the rains,
			came rushing down from the hills
			came rushing down from mountains in the north.

When they had crossed over the bridge
	It was nearly night
	The wind broke up the grey clouds,
	A moon appeared
		wandering
		above the hills
		between the flying rags.
	They stopped
	Thorin muttered
		something about supper
		"and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?
```
```
# Bad luck on their adventures

They Company noticed
	Gandalf
		was missing.
		had come all the way with them
		Never said if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while.
		Had eaten most
		Had talked most,
		Had laughed most.
		Simply was not there at all!

Dori and Nori
	groaned
		"Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too,"
	shared the hobbit's views about
		regular meals.
		plenty meals.
		often meals.


They decided
	in the end
	they would have to camp where they were.
	to move to a clump of trees
		because it was drier under them,
		although
			the wind shook the rain off the leaves,
			the drip, drip, was most annoying.
	to make a fire
		But they could not do it that night
			Because the mischief seemed to have got into the fire.
			Even though
				Dwarves can make a fire
					almost anywhere
					out of almost anything,
					wind or no wind;
				Oin and Gloin were specially good at it.

One of the ponies
	took fright at nothing
	bolted.
	got into the river
		before they could catch him
		and before they could get him out again,
			Fili and Kili were nearly drowned
			all the baggage that he carried
				was washed away off him.
				was mostly food,
					and there was mighty little left for supper,
					and less for breakfast.

There they all sat
	glum.
	wet.
	muttering.
	
Oin and Gloin went on
	trying to light the fire
	quarrelling about it.
	
Bilbo was reflecting
	sadly
	that adventures are not all
		pony-rides
		in May-sunshine
```
```
# The Company sees a light

Balin
	who was always their look-out man
	said: "There's a light over there!"

	Was a hill
		some way off
			with trees
				on it
				pretty thick in parts.
				a dark mass of them
		with now a light
			shining,
			reddish
			comfortable-looking
			that might be a fire
			that might be torches twinkling.

The Dwarves
	had looked at it for some while,
	fell to arguing.
	Some said "no"
	Some said "yes".
	Some said
		they could but go and see,
		anything was better than
			little supper
			less breakfast
			wet clothes all the night.
	Others said:
		These parts are
			none too well known
			too near the mountains.
		Travellers seldom come this way now.
		The old maps are no use because
			Things have changed for the worse
			The road is unguarded.
		They have seldom even heard of the king round here
		The less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find."
	Some said:
		"After all there are fourteen of us."
	All repeated the remark:
		"Where has Gandalf got to?"
	Settled it because:
		the rain began to pour down worse than ever
		Oin and Gloin began to fight.
		They said, "After all we have got a burglar with us,"
	Made off
		leading their ponies
		(with all due and proper caution)
		in the direction of the light.
	Soon
		Came to the hill
		Were in the wood.
		Up the hill they went;
	As they went through
		the trees
		in the pitch dark.
		There was no proper path
			to be seen,
			such as might lead to a house or a farm;
		and do what they could,
			they made a deal of
				rustling
				crackling
				creaking
			(they made a good deal of
				grumbling
				dratting)


Suddenly the red light shone out
	very bright
	through the tree-trunks
	not far ahead.
```
```
# They decide to sned Bilbo to investigate

They said,
	to Bilbo
	"Now it is the burglar's turn,"
	"You must
		"go on
		"find out
			"all about that light
			"what it is for
			"if all is perfectly safe and canny

Thorin said to Bilbo,
	"Now scuttle off,
	"if all is well. come back quick,
	"If not,
		"come back if you can! If you can't,
			hoot twice like a barn-owl
			hoot once like a screech-owl,
			we will do what we can."

Bilbo
	had to go
		off
		before he could explain
			that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat.
	knew Hobbits
		at any rate can move
			quietly in woods,
			absolutely quietly.
			so quietly
				I don't supposed you or I would have noticed
					anything at all on a windy night,
					if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off.
				even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it.
		take a pride in it [their quiet movement]
	had sniffed
		more than once
		at what he called "all this dwarvish racket,"
		as they went along,
	walked primly towards the red light
	this is what he saw...
	So, naturally,
		he got right up
			to the fire—for fire it was—
			without disturbing anyone.
```
```
# Bilbo sees that they are trolls

They Were
	three very large persons
	sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs.
	toasting mutton on long spits of wood,
	licking the gravy off their fingers.
There Was
	a fine toothsome smell.
	also a barrel of good drink at hand
They were
	drinking out of jugs.
But they were
	trolls.
	Obviously trolls.
Even Bilbo
	in spite of his sheltered life
	could see that they were trolls
		from the great heavy faces of them,
		from their size,
		from the shape of their legs,
		not to mention from their language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at all.
```
