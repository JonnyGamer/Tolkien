# Bilbo Wakes Up after the party

Bilbo jumped
	Up.
Bilbo put on
	His dressing-gown.
Bilbo went
	Into the dining-room.
Bilbo saw
	Nobody.
	All the signs of
		a large breakfast.
		a hurried breakfast.
		a fearful mess.
		a mess in the room.
	Crocks
		Piles of them.
		Unwashed.
		In the kitchen.
	Pots and pans
		Nearly every one he possessed.
		Used.
Bilbo was forced to believe
	The party
		of the night before.
		had not been
			part of his bad dreams
			as he had rather 
		because washing-up
			was so dismally real.
Bilbo was relieved
	Really after all
	To think that they had all gone without
		him
		bothering to wake him up
		a thank-you
Bilbo felt
	That he could not help feeling.
	Just a trifle disappointed.
	Surprised by the feeling.
Bilbo said
	To himself.
	"Don't be a fool"
		"Bilbo Baggins"
		"Thinking at your age of"
			"dragons"
			"all that outlandish nonsense"
Bilbo put on
	An apron.
Bilbo lit
	Fires.
Bilbo boiled
	Water.
Bilbo washed
	Up.
Bilbo went
	In the kitchen.
Bilbo had
	A nice little breakfast.
Bilbo turned out
	The dining-room.
Bilbo began to
	Whistle loudly.
	Forget about the night before.
	Sit down
		to a nice little second beakfast
		in the dining-room	
		by the open window
```
```
By that time
	the sun was shining
	the front door was
		open
		letting in a warm spring breeze
	In Walked Gandalf!
```

# Bilbo and Gandalf's Conversation

Gandalf said,
	"My dear fellow,"
	"Whenever are you going to come?"
	"What about an early start?"
	"And here you are"
		"having"
			"breakfast"
			"whatever you call it,
		"at half past ten!"
	"They left you"
		"the message"
		"because they could not wait."
Bilbo
	who was
		Poor Mr. Baggins
		in all a fluster,
	said "What message?"
Gandald said,
	"Great Elephants!"
	"You"
		"are not at all yourself this morning"
		"have never dusted the mantelpiece!"
Bilbo said,
	"What's that got to do with it?"
	"I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!"
Gandalf
	said,
		"If you had"
			"dusted the mantelpiece"
				"you would have found"
					"this just under the clock,"
	handed a note
		written on his own note-paper
			of course
		to Bilbo
Bilbo
	Read the note.
Gandalf said
	"you"
		"are left just ten minutes"
		"will have to run"
Biblo said
	"But."
The wizard said,
	"No time for it,"
Biblo said again
	"But"
Gandalf said,
	"No time for that either!"
	"Off you go!"
