# Bilbo Wakes Up after the party

Bilbo jumped
	Up.
Bilbo put on
	His dressing-gown.
Bilbo went
	Into the dining-room.
Bilbo saw
	Nobody.
	All the signs of
		a large breakfast.
		a hurried breakfast.
		a fearful mess.
		a mess in the room.
	Crocks
		Piles of them.
		Unwashed.
		In the kitchen.
	Pots and pans
		Nearly every one he possessed.
		Used.
Bilbo was forced to believe
	The party
		of the night before.
		had not been
			part of his bad dreams
			as he had rather hoped.
		because washing-up
			was so dismally real.
Bilbo was relieved
	Really after all
	To think that they had all gone without
		him
		bothering to wake him up
		a thank-you
Bilbo felt
	That he could not help feeling.
	Just a trifle disappointed.
	Surprised by the feeling.
Bilbo said
	To himself.
	"Don't be a fool"
		"Bilbo Baggins"
		"Thinking at your age of"
			"dragons"
			"all that outlandish nonsense"
Bilbo put on
	An apron.
Bilbo lit
	Fires.
Bilbo boiled
	Water.
Bilbo washed
	Up.
Bilbo went
	In the kitchen.
Bilbo had
	A nice little breakfast.
Bilbo turned out
	The dining-room.
Bilbo began to
	Whistle loudly.
	Forget about the night before.
	Sit down
		to a nice little second beakfast
		in the dining-room	
		by the open window
		when, by that time
			the sun was shining
			the front door was
				open
			letting in a warm spring breeze
			In walked Gandalf!
```
```
# Bilbo and Gandalf's Conversation

Gandalf said,
	"My dear fellow,"
	"Whenever are you going to come?"
	"What about an early start?"
	"And here you are"
		"having"
			"breakfast"
			"whatever you call it,
		"at half past ten!"
	"They left you"
		"the message"
		"because they could not wait."
Bilbo
	who was
		Poor Mr. Baggins
		in all a fluster,
	said "What message?"
Gandald said,
	"Great Elephants!"
	"You"
		"are not at all yourself this morning"
		"have never dusted the mantelpiece!"
Bilbo said,
	"What's that got to do with it?"
	"I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!"
Gandalf
	said,
		"If you had"
			"dusted the mantelpiece"
				"you would have found"
					"this just under the clock,"
	handed a note
		written on his own note-paper
			of course
		to Bilbo
Bilbo
	Read the note.
Gandalf said
	"you"
		"are left just ten minutes"
		"will have to run"
Biblo said
	"But."
The wizard said,
	"No time for it,"
Biblo said again
	"But"
Gandalf said,
	"No time for that either!"
	"Off you go!"

# Bilbo Leaves and joins The Company!

Bilbo could never remember
	To the end of his days
	how he found himself
		outside
		without
			a hat
			a walking-stick
			any money
			anything that he usually took when he went out
		leaving
			his second breakfast
				half-finished
				quite unwashed-up
		pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands
		running
			as fast as his furry feet could carry him
			down the lane,
			past the great Mill,
			across The Water,
			and then on
			for a mile or more.
Bilbo was very puffed
	when he got to Bywater
	just on the stroke of eleven
Bilbo found he had come
	without a pocket-handkerchief!
Balin said
	"Bravo!"
Balin was
	standing at the inn door
	looking out for him.
All the others came
	Just then
	round the corner of the road
	from the village.
All the others were on ponies
	with all kinds of
		baggages slung about.
		packages slung about.
		parcels slung about.
		paraphernalia slung about
All the others brought a pony
	that was very small.
	apparently for Bilbo.
Thorin said,
	"Up you two get"
	"and off we go!"
Bilbo said,
	"I'm awfully sorry,"
	"But I have come without my hat"
	"I have left my pocket-handkerchief behind"
	"I haven't got any money."
	"I didn't get your note until after 10.45 to be precise."
Dwalin said,
	Don't
		be precise,
		worry!
	You will have to manage without
		pocket-handkerchiefs,
		a good many other things,
		before you get to the journey's end.
	As for a hat, I have got
		a spare hood in my luggage
		a cloak in my luggage.
Bilbo was wearing
	a hood
		dark-green
		(a little weather-stained)
	a cloak
		dark-green
		borrowed from Dwalin.
	things that
		were too large for him
		made him look rather comic.
		you daren't think what his father Bungo would have thought of him
Bilbo was not wearing
	a beard
		which was his only comfort
		so he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf
Bilbo thought
	the meals didn't come quite as often as he would have liked them,
	began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.
```
```
# The Adventure Begins

The Company
	Started on their adventure
		jogging off from the inn
		one fine morning
		just before May,
		on laden ponies;
	Had not been riding very long
		when up came Gandalf
			very splendid
			on a white horse
			who had brought
				a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs,
				Bilbo's pipe
				Bilbo's tobacco.
			making the party go off along
				very merrily
	Rode forward all day
		telling stories
		sang songs
		except of course
			when they stopped for meals.
	First
		passed through hobbit-lands,
			a wide country
			a respectable country
			a country inhabited by decent folk,
			a country with
				good roads
				an inn or two,
				now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business.
	Then
		they came to lands where people
			spoke strangely,
			sang songs Bilbo had never heard before.
	Now in the Lone-lands,
		they had gone on
			far
			where there were
				no people left
				no inns
				roads growing steadily worse.
		they had been obliged to camp when they could,
		at least it had been dry.
	Not far ahead
		were hills that
			looked dreary
			were rising higher and higher
			had dark with trees.
			on some of them
				had old castles
					with an evil look
					as if they had been built by wicked people.
	The weather that day
		made everything seemed gloomy
		had taken a nasty turn.
		had been
			Mostly as good as May can be, can be, even in merry tales,
		now was
			cold
			wet.

```
```
# Bilbo Grubmles

Bilbo
	said, "To think it will soon be June!"
	splashed along
		behind the others
		in a very muddy track.
	grumbled because
		It was after tea-time
		It was pouring with rain
		It had been all day;
		his hood was dripping into his eyes
		his cloak was full of water;
		the pony
			was tired
			stumbled on stones
		the others were too grumpy to talk.
	thought,
		"And I'm sure the rain has got into
			the dry clothes
			the food-bags
		"Bother
			burgling
			everything to do with burgling!
	wished,
		"He was at home"
		"He was in hus nice hole"
		"He was by the fire"
		"The kettle just beginning to sing!"
		(It was not the last time that he wished that!)
```
```
# Good luck on their adventures

The Dwarves
	still jogged on,
	never
		turned round
		took any notice of the hobbit.

As they went
	The sun must have gone down somewhere behind the grey clouds
	Everything began to get dark
	Down into a deep valley with a river at the bottom.
	Wind got up
	Willows along its banks bent and sighed.

They Company went
	Fortunately
	over
		an ancient stone bridge
		the river which
			was swollen with the rains,
			came rushing down from the hills
			came rushing down from mountains in the north.

When they had crossed over the bridge
	It was nearly night
	The wind broke up the grey clouds,
	A moon appeared
		wandering
		above the hills
		between the flying rags.
	They stopped
	Thorin muttered
		something about supper
		"and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?
```
```
# Bad luck on their adventures

They Company noticed
	Gandalf
		was missing.
		had come all the way with them
		Never said if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while.
		Had eaten most
		Had talked most,
		Had laughed most.
		Simply was not there at all!

Dori and Nori
	groaned
		"Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too,"
	shared the hobbit's views about
		regular meals.
		plenty meals.
		often meals.


They decided
	in the end
	they would have to camp where they were.
	to move to a clump of trees
		because it was drier under them,
		although
			the wind shook the rain off the leaves,
			the drip, drip, was most annoying.
	to make a fire
		But they could not do it that night
			Because the mischief seemed to have got into the fire.
			Even though
				Dwarves can make a fire
					almost anywhere
					out of almost anything,
					wind or no wind;
				Oin and Gloin were specially good at it.

One of the ponies
	took fright at nothing
	bolted.
	got into the river
		before they could catch him
		and before they could get him out again,
			Fili and Kili were nearly drowned
			all the baggage that he carried
				was washed away off him.
				was mostly food,
					and there was mighty little left for supper,
					and less for breakfast.

There they all sat
	glum.
	wet.
	muttering.
	
Oin and Gloin went on
	trying to light the fire
	quarrelling about it.
	
Bilbo was reflecting
	sadly
	that adventures are not all
		pony-rides
		in May-sunshine
```
```
# The Company sees a light

Balin
	who was always their look-out man
	said: "There's a light over there!"

	Was a hill
		some way off
			with trees
				on it
				pretty thick in parts.
				a dark mass of them
		with now a light
			shining,
			reddish
			comfortable-looking
			that might be a fire
			that might be torches twinkling.

The Dwarves
	had looked at it for some while,
	fell to arguing.
	Some said "no"
	Some said "yes".
	Some said
		they could but go and see,
		anything was better than
			little supper
			less breakfast
			wet clothes all the night.
	Others said:
		These parts are
			none too well known
			too near the mountains.
		Travellers seldom come this way now.
		The old maps are no use because
			Things have changed for the worse
			The road is unguarded.
		They have seldom even heard of the king round here
		The less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find."
	Some said:
		"After all there are fourteen of us."
	All repeated the remark:
		"Where has Gandalf got to?"
	Settled it because:
		the rain began to pour down worse than ever
		Oin and Gloin began to fight.
		They said, "After all we have got a burglar with us,"
	Made off
		leading their ponies
		(with all due and proper caution)
		in the direction of the light.
	Soon
		Came to the hill
		Were in the wood.
		Up the hill they went;
	As they went through
		the trees
		in the pitch dark.
		There was no proper path
			to be seen,
			such as might lead to a house or a farm;
		and do what they could,
			they made a deal of
				rustling
				crackling
				creaking
			(they made a good deal of
				grumbling
				dratting)


Suddenly the red light shone out
	very bright
	through the tree-trunks
	not far ahead.
```
```
# They decide to sned Bilbo to investigate

They said,
	to Bilbo
	"Now it is the burglar's turn,"
	"You must
		"go on
		"find out
			"all about that light
			"what it is for
			"if all is perfectly safe and canny

Thorin said to Bilbo,
	"Now scuttle off,
	"if all is well. come back quick,
	"If not,
		"come back if you can! If you can't,
			hoot twice like a barn-owl
			hoot once like a screech-owl,
			we will do what we can."

Bilbo
	had to go
		off
		before he could explain
			that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat.
	knew Hobbits
		at any rate can move
			quietly in woods,
			absolutely quietly.
			so quietly
				I don't supposed you or I would have noticed
					anything at all on a windy night,
					if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off.
				even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it.
		take a pride in it [their quiet movement]
	had sniffed
		more than once
		at what he called "all this dwarvish racket,"
		as they went along,
	walked primly towards the red light
	this is what he saw...
	So, naturally,
		he got right up
			to the fire—for fire it was—
			without disturbing anyone.
```
```
# Bilbo sees that they are trolls

They Were
	three very large persons
	sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs.
	toasting mutton on long spits of wood,
	licking the gravy off their fingers.
There Was
	a fine toothsome smell.
	also a barrel of good drink at hand
They were
	drinking out of jugs.
But they were
	trolls.
	Obviously trolls.
Even Bilbo
	in spite of his sheltered life
	could see that they were trolls
		from the great heavy faces of them,
		from their size,
		from the shape of their legs,
		not to mention from their language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at all.
```
```
# The trolls talk amongst themselves

One of the Trolls said
	Mutton
		yesterday
		today
	blimey
		if it don't look like mutton
			again tomorrer

Second Troll
	said
		"Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough,"
		"What the 'ell William was a-thinkin' of to bring us into these parts at all, beats me—
		"The drink runnin' short, what's more,"
	jogged the elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his jug.

William
	chocked
	as soon as he could, said,
		Shut yer mouth!
		Yer can't expect folk
			to stop here for ever
			just to be et by
				you
				and Bert
		You've et
			a village and a half
			between yer, since we come down from the mountains.
		How much more d'yer want?
		And time's been up our way, when yer'd have said 'thank yer Bill' for a nice bit o' fat valley mutton like what this is.
	Was
		roasting a sheep's leg
	Took
		a big bite off of what he was roasting
	Wiped
		his lips on his sleeve.

Trolls behave
	that way
		I am afraid.
		even those with only one head each.
```
```
# Bilbo decides to burgle the trolls

Bilbo
	After hearing all this
		ought to have
			Done something at once.
			Gone back
				quietly
				and warned his friends that there were
					trolls
						three of them
						at hand
						in a nasty mood
						quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even pony, for a change;
			Done a bit of good quick burgling.
	Knew
		A really first-class and legendary burglar
			would at this point have
				picked the trolls' pockets—
					it is nearly always worth while,
					if you can manage it—,
				pinched the very mutton off the spits,
				purloined the beer,
				walked off without their noticing him.
		Other burglers
			more practical but with less professional pride
			would perhaps have
				stuck a dagger
					into each of them
					before they observed it.
				the night spent cheerily.
		these things because
			He had read of a good many things he had never
				seen
				done.
	Was very much
		alarmed,
		disgusted;
	Wished himself
		a hundred miles away,
	He could not go to Thorin and Company.
		(and yet—and yet) somehow 
		straight back
		emptyhanded
	stood in the shadows
	hesitated in the shadows.
	Thought
		Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the least difficult,
	He crept
		at last
		behind a tree
		just behind William
```
```
# Bilbo attempts to burgle the trolls

Bert and Tom
	went off to the barrel.
William
	was having another drink.

Bilbo
	plucked up courage
	put his little hand in William's enormous pocket.
		There was a purse
			in it,
			as big as a bag to Bilbo.
	thought, "Ha!"
	was warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out,
	thought, "this is a beginning!"
		(It was!)

Trolls' purses
	are the mischief,
This purse
	was no exception.
	squeaked
		"'Ere, 'oo are you?"
		as it left the pocket;


William
	turned round
		at once
		and grabbed Bilbo
			by the neck,
			before he could duck behind the tree.
	said, "Blimey, Bert, look what I've copped!"
```
```
# The trolls figure out Bilbo

The other trolls
	said "What is it?"
	were coming up to William.
William said,
	"Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?"
Poor Bilbo
	said "Bilbo Baggins, a bur—a hobbit,"
	shaking all over,
	wondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him.
The Trolls
	said "A burrahobbit?"
	were a bit startled.
Trolls
	are slow in the uptake,
	are mighty suspicious about anything new to them.
William said,
	"What's a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?"
Tom said
	"And can yer cook 'em?"
Bert
	said "Yer can try,"
	picked up a skewer.
William
	said "He wouldn't make above a mouthful,"
	had already had a fine supper,
	said, "not when he was skinned and boned."
Bert
	said
		"P'raps there are more like him round about,
		"we might make a pie,"
		"Here you, are there any more of your sort a-sneakin' in these here woods, yer nassty little rabbit,"
	looking at the hobbit's furry feet;
	picked Bilbo up
		by the toes
		and shook him.
Bilbo
	said, "Yes, lots,"
	said this before he remembered not to give his friends away.
	immediately afterwards said, "No none at all, not one,"
Bert
	said, "What d'yer mean?"
	holding Bilbo right way up, by the hair this time.
Bilbo
	gasping
	said,
		"What I say, and please don't cook me, kind sirs!"
		"I am a good cook myself, and cook better than I cook, if you see what I mean."
		"I'll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won't have me for supper."
William
	said, "Poor little blighter,"
	had already had as much supper as he could hold;
	also had had lots of beer.
	said, "Poor little blighter! Let him go!"
Bert said,
	"Not till he says what he means by lots and none at all,"
	"I don't want to have me throat cut in me sleep!"
	"Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!"
William said,
	"I won't have it,"
	"I caught him anyway."
```
```
# The trolls fight, and Bilbo escapes

Bert said,
	"You're a fat fool, William,"
	"as I've said afore this evening."
William said,
	"And you're a lout!"
Bert
	said "And I won't take that from you, Bill Huggins,"
	puts his fist in William's eye.
The Trolls
	had a gorgeous row.
Bert
	dropped Bilbo on the ground


Bilbo
	had just enough wits left,
	scrambled out of the way of their feet, before they were
		fighting like dogs,
		calling one another
			all sorts of perfectly
				true names
				applicable names
			in very loud voices.


The Trolls
	were locked in one another's arms,
	rolling nearly into the fire
		kicking
		thumping,
Tom
	whacked at them both with a branch to bring them to their senses
	of course only made them madder than ever.


Bilbo
	would have been the time for Bilbo to have left.
	his poor little feet had been very squashed in Bert's big paw
	had no breath in his body,
	his head was going round;
	lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight.
```
```
The Dwarves attemp to save Bilbo, and fight the trolls

Balin
	came up
		Right in the middle of the fight
The Dwarves
	had heard noises from a distance,
	after waiting
		for some time
		for Bilbo
			to come back,
			to hoot like an owl
		they started off
			one by one
			creeping
			towards the light
			as quietly as they could.


Tom
	saw Balin come into the light
	gave an awful howl no sooner

Trolls
	simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked).

Bert and Bill
	stopped fighting immediately,
	said, "a sack, Tom, quick!"

Balin
	was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo was
	Before he knew what was happening
		a sack was over his head,
		he was down.

Tom said,
	"There's more to come yet,"
	"or I'm mighty mistook."
	"Lots and none at all, it is,"
	"No burrahobbits, but lots of these here dwarves."
	"That's about the shape of it!"
Bert said
	"I reckon you're right,"
	"and we'd best get out of the light."
The Trolls
	got out of the light
	With sacks
		in their hands
		that they used for carrying off
			mutton
			other plunder,
	waited in the shadows.

Each of the dwarves
	Came up
	looked at
		the fire,
		the spilled jugs,
		the gnawed mutton
	in surprise,
		pop!
		went a nasty smelly sack over his head,
		he was down.
Soon
	Dwalin lay by Balin
	Fili and Kili together,
	all in a heap,
		Dori and Nori and Ori
	piled uncomfortably near the fire.
		Oin and Gloin
		Bifur and Bofur and Bombur

Tom said,
	"That'll teach 'em,"
	this because Bifur and Bombur
		had given a lot of trouble,
		fought like mad,
		did as dwarves will when cornered.

Thorin
	came last
	was not caught unawares.
	came expecting mischief
	didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well.
	stood outside in the shadows some way off,
	said
		"What's all this trouble?"
		"Who has been knocking my people about?"

Bilbo
	behind a tree
	said "It's trolls!"
	The Trolls had forgotten all about him
	said, "They're hiding in the bushes with sacks,"

Thorin
	said "O! are they?"
	jumped forward to the fire, before they could leap on him.
	caught up a big branch all on fire at one end;

Bert
	Bert got that end in his eye before he could step aside.
	was put out of the battle for a bit.

Bilbo
	did his best.
	caught hold of Tom's leg—as well as he could

Tom
	his leg was thick as a young tree-trunk
	sent Bilbo
		spinning up
		into the top of some bushes,
	Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin's face.
	got the branch in his teeth for that
	lost one of the front ones [teeth]
		which made him howl, I can tell you.

William
	just at that moment
	came up behind
	popped a sack right over Thorin's head and down to his toes

And so the fight ended.
```
```
# The trolls figure out what to do with the dwarves, but get turned into stone

The Dwarves were all
	In a nice pickle now:
	neatly tied up in sacks,
	with trolls
		three
		angry
		(and two with burns and bashes to remember)
		sitting by them,
		arguing whether they should
			roast them slowly,
			mince them fine and boil them,
			just
				sit on them one by one
				squash them into jelly;


Bilbo
	was up in a bush,
	with his clothes and his skin torn,
	not daring to move for fear they should hear him.

Gandalf
	It was just then that he came back.
	But no one saw him.


The trolls
	had just decided
		to roast the dwarves now and eat them later
		on Bert's idea, and after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it.

A Voice, said,
	"No good roasting 'em now, it'd take all night,"
Bert said
	thought the Voice was William's
	"Don't start the argument all over again, Bill,"
	"or it will take all night."
William
	said "Who's a-arguing?"
	thought it was Bert that had spoken.
Bert
	said "You are,"
William
	said "You're a liar,"
	began the argument all over again.
The trolls
	In the end
	decided to mince them fine and boil them.
	got a great black pot,
	took out their knives.
A Voice said
	"No good boiling 'em!"
	"We ain't got no water,"
	"it's a long way to the well and all,"
Bert and William
	thought the Voice was Tom's.
	said
		"Shut up!"
		"or we'll never have done."
		"And yer can fetch the water yerself, if yer say any more."
Tom
	said "Shut up yerself!"
	thought it was William's voice.
	said "Who's arguing but you, I'd like to know."
William said
	"You're a booby,"
Tom said
	"Booby yerself!"

The trolls
	argument
		began all over again,
		went on
			hotter than ever,
			until at last they decided to
				sit on the sacks one by one and squash them,
				boil them next time.

The Voice said
	"Who shall we sit on first?"
Bert said,
	"Better sit on the last fellow first,"
	whose eye had been damaged by Thorin.
	thought Tom was talking.
Tom said
	"Don't talk to yerself!"
	"But if you wants to sit on the last one, sit on him."
	"Which is he?"
Bert said
	"The one with the yellow stockings,"
The Voice
	said "Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings,"
	was like William's.
Bert said
	"I made sure it was yellow,"
William said
	"Yellow it was,"
Bert said
	"Then what did yer say it was grey for?"
William said
	"I never did. Tom said it."
Tom said
	"That I never did!"
	"It was you."
Bert said
	"Two to one, so shut yer mouth!"
William
	"Who are you a-talkin' to?"
Tom and Bert said together
	"Now stop it!"
	"The night's gettin' on, and dawn comes early."
	"Let's get on with it!"
The Voice
	said "Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!"
	sounded like William's.
	wasn't William's voice


There was
	just at that moment
	the light that came over the hill,
	a mighty twitter in the branches.

William
	never spoke
	stopped as he stood
	turned to stone
Bert and Tom
	were stuck like rocks
	looked at William.
Bert and Tom and William
	stand there to this day
	are all alone
		unless the birds perch on them;
Trolls
	must be underground
		as you probably know
		before dawn
		or else they
			go back to what they are made of,
			never move again.
	are made of the stuff of the mountains
Bert and Tom and William
	had this happened to them.

# Gandalf lets out all the dwarves and decide what to do next

Gandalf
	said	"Excellent!"
	stepped from behind a tree,
	helped Bilbo
		to climb down
		out of a thorn-bush.

Bilbo
	understood it was the wizard's voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them.


The Dwarves
	were
		let out once the sacks were untied
		nearly suffocated,
		very annoyed:
	had not at all enjoyed
		lying there
		listening to the trolls making plans for
			roasting them
			squashing them
			mincing them.
	had to hear
		Bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice over,
		before they were satisfied.


Bombur said
	"Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking,"
	"when what we wanted was fire and food!"
Gandalf said,
	"And that's just what you wouldn't have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,"
	"Anyhow you are wasting time now."
	"Don't you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in?"
	"We must look into it!"
They all
	searched about,
	soon found marks
		of trolls'
		of stony boots
		going away through the trees.
	followed
		the tracks up the hill,
		until they came upon a door
			which was big
			hidden by the bushes
			of stone
			leading to a cave.
			which they could not open, though
				they all pushed
				Gandalf tried various incantations.
```

# The Company enters the Trolls cave

Bilbo
	asked
		"Would this be any good?"
		when they were
			getting tired
			getting angry.
	said "I found it
		"on the ground
		"where the trolls had their fight
	held out a key
		largish
		which no doubt William had thought was
			very small
			secret.
		which must have fallen
			out of William's pocket
			very luckily
			before William was turned to stone.

The Company
	cried, "Why on earth didn't you mention it before?"

Gandalf
	grabbed it
	fitted it into the keyhole.

The Company
	swung back
		the stone door
		with one big push
	went
		inside
	saw
		bones on the floor
		a nasty smell was in the air;
		food
			a good deal of it
			jumbled carelessly
				on shelves
				on the ground,
		plunder
			an untidy litter of it
			all sorts
			brass buttons
			pots
				full of gold coins
				standing in a corner.
		clothes
			lots, too
			hanging on the walls
			too small for trolls,
			which I am afraid they belonged to victims
		swords
			among everything else
			of various
				makes
				shapes
				sizes
	caught their eyes on
		two swords
			particularly
			because of their
				beautiful scabbards
				jewelled hilts.


Gandalf and Thorin
	each took one of these;
Bilbo
	took a knife
		in a leather sheath.
		which would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll,
		which was as good as a short sword for the hobbit.
The Wizard
	half drawing them
	looking at them curiously.
	said the swords
		"look like good blades
		"were not made by
			"any troll,
			"any smith among men
				"in these parts
				"in these days;
		"we shall know more about them
			but when we can read the runes on them,
```
