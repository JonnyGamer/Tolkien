Bilbo
	A. Jumped

		All the signs of:
			a large breakfast
			a hurried breakfast
			a fearful mess
			a mess in the room
		Crocks:
			Piles of them.
			Unwashed.
			In the kitchen.
		Pots and pans:
			Nearly every one he possessed.
			Used.
	E. Was forced to believe
		the party
			of the night before.
			had not been
				part of his bad dreams
				as he had rather 
			washing-up
				was so dismally real.
	F. Was relieved
		really after all
		to think that they had all gone without
			him
			bothering to wake him up
			a thank-you
	G. Felt
		That he could not help feeling
		just a trifle disappointed
		surprised by the feeling.
	H. Said
		to himself
		"Don't be a fool"
			"Bilbo Baggins"
			"Thinking at your age of"
				"dragons"
				"all that outlandish nonsense"
	I. Put on
		an apron
	J. Lit
		fires
	K. Boiled
		water
	L. Washed
		up
	M. Went
		in the kitchen
	N. Had
		a nice little breakfast.
	O. Turned out
		the dining-room.
	P. Began to
		whistle loudly
		forget about the night before
		sit down
			to a nice little second beakfast
			in the dining-room	
			by the open window
