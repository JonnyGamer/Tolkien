# Bilbo and Gandalf's Conversation

Gandalf said,
	"My dear fellow,"
	"Whenever are you going to come?"
	"What about an early start?"
	"And here you are"
		"having"
			"breakfast"
			"whatever you call it,
		"at half past ten!"
	"They left you"
		"the message"
		"because they could not wait."
Bilbo
	who was
		Poor Mr. Baggins
		in all a fluster,
	said "What message?"
Gandald said,
	"Great Elephants!"
	"You"
		"are not at all yourself this morning"
		"have never dusted the mantelpiece!"
Bilbo said,
	"What's that got to do with it?"
	"I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!"
Gandalf
	said,
		"If you had"
			"dusted the mantelpiece"
				"you would have found"
					"this just under the clock,"
	handed a note
		written on his own note-paper
			of course
		to Bilbo
Bilbo
	Read the note.
Gandalf said
	"you"
		"are left just ten minutes"
		"will have to run"
Biblo said
	"But."
The wizard said,
	"No time for it,"
Biblo said again
	"But"
Gandalf said,
	"No time for that either!"
	"Off you go!"
