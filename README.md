# Bilbo Wakes Up after the party

Bilbo jumped
	Up.
Bilbo put on
	His dressing-gown.
Bilbo went
	Into the dining-room.
Bilbo saw
	Nobody.
	All the signs of
		a large breakfast.
		a hurried breakfast.
		a fearful mess.
		a mess in the room.
	Crocks
		Piles of them.
		Unwashed.
		In the kitchen.
	Pots and pans
		Nearly every one he possessed.
		Used.
Bilbo was forced to believe
	The party
		of the night before.
		had not been
			part of his bad dreams
			as he had rather hoped.
		because washing-up
			was so dismally real.
Bilbo was relieved
	Really after all
	To think that they had all gone without
		him
		bothering to wake him up
		a thank-you
Bilbo felt
	That he could not help feeling.
	Just a trifle disappointed.
	Surprised by the feeling.
Bilbo said
	To himself.
	"Don't be a fool"
		"Bilbo Baggins"
		"Thinking at your age of"
			"dragons"
			"all that outlandish nonsense"
Bilbo put on
	An apron.
Bilbo lit
	Fires.
Bilbo boiled
	Water.
Bilbo washed
	Up.
Bilbo went
	In the kitchen.
Bilbo had
	A nice little breakfast.
Bilbo turned out
	The dining-room.
Bilbo began to
	Whistle loudly.
	Forget about the night before.
	Sit down
		to a nice little second beakfast
		in the dining-room	
		by the open window
		when, by that time
			the sun was shining
			the front door was
				open
			letting in a warm spring breeze
			In walked Gandalf!

# Bilbo and Gandalf's Conversation

Gandalf said,
	"My dear fellow,"
	"Whenever are you going to come?"
	"What about an early start?"
	"And here you are"
		"having"
			"breakfast"
			"whatever you call it,
		"at half past ten!"
	"They left you"
		"the message"
		"because they could not wait."
Bilbo
	who was
		Poor Mr. Baggins
		in all a fluster,
	said "What message?"
Gandald said,
	"Great Elephants!"
	"You"
		"are not at all yourself this morning"
		"have never dusted the mantelpiece!"
Bilbo said,
	"What's that got to do with it?"
	"I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!"
Gandalf
	said,
		"If you had"
			"dusted the mantelpiece"
				"you would have found"
					"this just under the clock,"
	handed a note
		written on his own note-paper
			of course
		to Bilbo
Bilbo
	Read the note.
Gandalf said
	"you"
		"are left just ten minutes"
		"will have to run"
Biblo said
	"But."
The wizard said,
	"No time for it,"
Biblo said again
	"But"
Gandalf said,
	"No time for that either!"
	"Off you go!"

# Bilbo Leaves and joins The Company!

Bilbo could never remember
	To the end of his days
	how he found himself
		outside
		without
			a hat
			a walking-stick
			any money
			anything that he usually took when he went out
		leaving
			his second breakfast
				half-finished
				quite unwashed-up
		pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands
		running
			as fast as his furry feet could carry him
			down the lane,
			past the great Mill,
			across The Water,
			and then on
			for a mile or more.
Bilbo was very puffed
	when he got to Bywater
	just on the stroke of eleven
Bilbo found he had come
	without a pocket-handkerchief!
Balin said
	"Bravo!"
Balin was
	standing at the inn door
	looking out for him.
All the others came
	Just then
	round the corner of the road
	from the village.
All the others were on ponies
	with all kinds of
		baggages slung about.
		packages slung about.
		parcels slung about.
		paraphernalia slung about
All the others brought a pony
	that was very small.
	apparently for Bilbo.
Thorin said,
	"Up you two get"
	"and off we go!"
Bilbo said,
	"I'm awfully sorry,"
	"But I have come without my hat"
	"I have left my pocket-handkerchief behind"
	"I haven't got any money."
	"I didn't get your note until after 10.45 to be precise."
Dwalin said,
	Don't
		be precise,
		worry!
	You will have to manage without
		pocket-handkerchiefs,
		a good many other things,
		before you get to the journey's end.
	As for a hat, I have got
		a spare hood in my luggage
		a cloak in my luggage.
Bilbo was wearing
	a hood
		dark-green
		(a little weather-stained)
	a cloak
		dark-green
		borrowed from Dwalin.
	things that
		were too large for him
		made him look rather comic.
		you daren't think what his father Bungo would have thought of him
Bilbo was not wearing
	a beard
		which was his only comfort
		so he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf
Bilbo thought
	the meals didn't come quite as often as he would have liked them,
	began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.
```

# The Adventure Begins

The Company
	Started on their adventure
		jogging off from the inn
		one fine morning
		just before May,
		on laden ponies;
	Had not been riding very long
		when up came Gandalf
			very splendid
			on a white horse
			who had brought
				a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs,
				Bilbo's pipe
				Bilbo's tobacco.
			making the party go off along
				very merrily
	Rode forward all day
		telling stories
		sang songs
		except of course
			when they stopped for meals.
	First
		passed through hobbit-lands,
			a wide country
			a respectable country
			a country inhabited by decent folk,
			a country with
				good roads
				an inn or two,
				now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business.
	Then
		they came to lands where people
			spoke strangely,
			sang songs Bilbo had never heard before.
	Now in the Lone-lands,
		they had gone on
			far
			where there were
				no people left
				no inns
				roads growing steadily worse.
		they had been obliged to camp when they could,
		at least it had been dry.
	Not far ahead
		were hills that
			looked dreary
			were rising higher and higher
			had dark with trees.
			on some of them
				had old castles
					with an evil look
					as if they had been built by wicked people.
	The weather that day
		made everything seemed gloomy
		had taken a nasty turn.
		had been
			Mostly as good as May can be, can be, even in merry tales,
		now was
			cold
			wet.
