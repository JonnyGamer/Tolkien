 That is how he got his name though he always called himself my precious
 If precious asks and it does n’t answer we eats it my preciousss
 It is n’t fair my precious is it to ask us what it ’s got in its nassty little pocketses
 Did we say so precious
 Not string precious but not nothing
 Cross it is impatient precious hissed Gollum
 He had a ring a golden ring a precious ring
 It came to me on my birthday my precious
 It wo n’t see us will it my precious
 Losst it is my precious lost lost
 Curse us and crush us my precious is lost
 No not yet precious
 Not a riddle precious no
 Oh we guess we guess my precious
 How did we lose it my precious
 We guesses precious only guesses
 It ca n’t get out that way precious
 Yes but if it ’s got the present our precious present then goblinses will get it gollum
 Then let ’s stop talking precious and make haste
 But we durs n’t go in precious no we durs n’t
 We must wait here precious wait a bit and see
 He had lost lost his prey and lost too the only thing he had ever cared for his precious
 He had precious little time he knew before the spiders were disgusted and came back to their trees where the dwarves were hung
 For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again
 Beneath him under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors lay countless piles of precious things gold wrought and unwrought gems and jewels and silver red stained in the ruddy light
 I would give a good many of these precious goblets he thought for a drink of something cheering out of one of Beorn ’s wooden bowls
 said Thorin laughing his spirits had begun to rise again and he rattled the precious stones in his pockets
 But few dared to cross the cursed spot and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the precious stones that fell from his rotting carcase
 It was the one thing he loved his precious and he talked to it even when it was not with him
 He was hungry now and angry and once his precious was with him he would not fear any weapon at all
 The light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his precious
 Warily Bilbo followed him as he went along cursing and talking to himself about his precious from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth and hope came to him in the darkness he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape from the orcs and from Gollum
 They had been locked up as if they were very precious but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green
 My precious
 Yes my precious
 I wo n't give my precious away I tell you
 And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it if he was so strong and it was so precious to him
 Surely the Ring was his precious and the only thing he cared for
 The murder of Deal haunted Gollum and he had made up a defence repeating it to his precious over and over again as he gnawed bones in the dark until he almost believed it
 It would n't say no precious
 We ought to have squeezed it yes precious
 And we will precious
 It was an admirable thing and altogether precious
 Show me the precious Ring
 It is precious to me though I buy it with great pain
 For I have many eyes in my service and I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies
 It is very precious
 We have already lost precious hours
 For Gandalf took the horse that is called Shadowfax the most precious of all the king 's steeds chief of the _Mearas_ which only the Lord of the Mark may ride
 What 's happened to your precious Nazgûl
 Nothing my precious he added
 An attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle
 Hours of my precious time he has wasted already
 then Legolas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls and the light glows through folded marbles shell like translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel
 I keep a treasure or two near my skin as precious as Rings to me
 I have kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
 When Saruman was safe back in Orthanc it was not long before he set some of his precious machinery to work
 I guess that even if we had entered in we could have found few treasures in Orthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us
 Every day that passes is a precious day lost
 Cautious my precious
 We musst n't rissk our neck musst we precious
 No precious _gollum_
 Nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it spies on us precious it hurts our eyes
 Where iss it where iss it my Precious my Precious
 Where are they with my Precious
 And what 's his Precious
 Do n't let them hurt us precious
 We did n't mean no harm but they jumps on us like cats on poor mices they did precious
 Yess wretched we are precious he whined
 No precious not the nice hobbits
 Once by accident it was was n't it precious
 They took his Precious and he 's lost now
 He 's lost his Precious said Gollum
 That 's why we tries to escape of course it is precious
 Sméagol will swear on the Precious
 On the Precious
 On the Precious. on the Precious
 But he must swear on the Precious
 I will serve the master of the Precious
 He spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke to his companions direct not to his precious self
 We are famisshed yes famisshed we are. precious he said
 But what is it they 've got precious
 And he wo n't leave his Precious anyway
 There was a great battle long ago yes so they told him when Sméagol was young when I was young before the Precious came
 We tried once .yes precious
 No precious
 Three precious little Gollums in a row we shall be if this goes on much longer thought Sam
 Very very weary of course so we are my precious all of us
 The Precious is their master
 Yes yes my precious came the answer we promised to save our Precious not to let Him have it never
 Yes yes to help the master the master of the Precious
 Very very good eh my precious
 But the Precious holds the promise the voice of Sméagol objected
 Still he 's a Baggins my precious yes a Baggins
 All peoples that keep the Precious
 See my precious if we has it then we can escape even from Him eh
 Most Precious Gollum
 They feel us here they feel the Precious
 The Precious is their master
 O yes. my precious we do see
 Do n't take the Precious to Him
 And he promised master made him promise to save the Precious
 Sam 's guess was that the Sméagol and Gollum halves or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker had made a truce and a temporary alliance neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring both wished to keep Frodo from capture and under their eye as long as possible at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his Precious
 If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put an end to his Precious for good and all there 'd be trouble pretty quick I bet
 Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of the Enemy and he 's under orders of some kind from him or was that he 'd give us away rather than be caught helping us and rather than let his Precious be melted maybe
 You swore a promise by what you call the Precious
 In the last need Sméagol I should put on the Precious and the Precious mastered you long ago
 Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious and I have searched and searched of course I have
 The Precious was ours it was mine I tell you
 He does n't eat grasses or roots no precious not till he 's starving or very sick poor Sméagol
 Sam 'll put his head in it yes precious
 Sméagol wo n't go O no precious not this time hissed Gollum
 What 's taters precious eh what 's taters
 We do n't see eye to eye and he 's not pleased with Sam O no precious not pleased at all
 It is precious to him
 White Face has vanished my precious at last yes
 No not in peace precious
 For Precious is lost yes lost
 Gone and left us _gollum_ and Precious is gone
 No Precious
 Nasty Men they 'll take it steal my Precious
 Throttle them precious
 Precious will be angry
 I shall take Precious and I shall say make him swallow the bones and choke
 Come Precious is waiting
 Or the Precious will be angry
 No name no business no Precious nothing
 Sméagol promises to Precious promises faithfully
 No precious no
 But I was forgetting his Precious
 No I suppose the whole time it 's been _The Precious for poor Sméagol_
 I think he really is in part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy. as long as he can
 Mark my words if ever we get to the pass he wo n't let us really take the precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble
 Very nice friends O yes my precious very nice
 He does n't know what we minds does he precious
 It may well be O yes it may well be that when She throws away the bones and the empty garments we shall find it we shall get it the Precious a reward for poor Sméagol who brings nice food
 And we 'll save the Precious as we promised
 And when we 've got it safe then She 'll know it O yes then we 'll pay Her back my precious
 Then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy he closed his hand about the precious Phial which he still bore
 At last my precious we 've got him yes the nassty hobbit
 He 's precious
 Now Sauron knows all this and he knows that this precious thing which he lost has been found again but he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
 It was clear at any rate that he had no hope of getting into the orc hold by that gate he might wait there for days before it was opened and he could not wait time was desperately precious
 I 've fought for the Tower against those stinking Morgul rats but a nice mess you two precious captains have made of things fighting over the swag
 Away below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and through the gate bearing his precious burden
 He felt that even minutes were precious but one by one they escaped and he could do nothing
 Keeping back the precious _lembas_ for the evil days ahead they ate the half of what remained in Sam 's bag of Faramir 's provision some dried fruit and a small slip of cured meat and they sipped some water
 Not to your precious Shagrat
 Sam took a sip of water but pressed Frodo to drink and when his master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made him eat it
 The clatter of his precious pans as they fell down into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
 And when Precious goes we 'll die yes die into the dust
 Precious precious precious
 My Precious
 O my Precious
 If you mean that your precious Chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild then we 've not come back too soon
 And where are those precious Shirriffs
 And Isengard has been destroyed and your precious master is a beggar in the wilderness
 We are just going up the Hill to remove your precious Boss
 So Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each
